    MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 30, 1996--Sofamor Danek Group, Inc. (NYSE:SDG) today announced that it has acquired the remaining 80.5% of the outstanding stock of Surgical Navigation Technology ("SNT") for an undisclosed amount. In March 1995, Sofamor Danek purchased 19.5% of the outstanding stock of SNT and acquired the exclusive worldwide license (except in Korea until 1997) to manufacture and distribute SNT products relating to frameless stereotactic surgery in spinal and neurological fields.

    Surgical Navigation Technology, Inc., a privately held company located in Broomfield, Colorado, has developed technology for a medical workstation, the StealthStation (TM) system, that interactively displays diagnostic images from magnetic resonance and computer tomography equipment. The StealthStation system incorporates patented technology that provides computer-assisted guidance for surgeons to precisely position a surgical instrument relative to the patient's anatomy.
