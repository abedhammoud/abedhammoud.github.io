  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    A model for data acquired with the use of a charge-coupled-device camera is given and is then used for developing a new iterative method for restoring intensities of objects observed with such a camera. The model includes the effects of point spread, photo-conversion noise, readout noise, nonuniform flat-field response, nonuniform spectral response, and extraneous charge carriers resulting from bias, dark current, and both internal and external background radiation. An iterative algorithm is identified that produces a sequence of estimates converging toward a constrained maximum-likelihood estimate of the intensity distribution of an imaged object. An example is given for restoring images from data acquired with the use of the Hubble Space Telescope.
