<h2>Renishaw neuromate® robot installation in Cologne, Germany</h2>

<p><strong>April 2014</strong> - Renishaw is pleased to announce that a neuromate® stereotactic robotic system has been installed at the the Department of Stereotaxy and Functional Neurosurgery of the University Hospital in Cologne, Germany.</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Veerle Visser-Vandewalle, the Head of the department of Stereotaxy and Functional Neurosurgery said, "We are aiming for the highest possible accuracy, the robot will certainly help us with that. The neuromate® robotic system will provide me and my team with a higher level of accuracy in targeting deep brain structures; we think of it as our third arm assisting us during the surgical procedure. We will use the neuromate® for Deep Brain Stimulation electrode implantation, for Stereo EEG procedures, tumour biopsies, robot-assisted Brachytherapy and many other applications."</p>

<p>Dr. Abed Hammoud, CEO of Renishaw Mayfield SA said, "This latest neuromate® installation at the renowned University Clinic in Cologne confirms the trust of yet another leading neurosurgical team in the system and in Renishaw. Our clinical and technical support teams are looking forward to working closely with Prof. Dr. Veerle Visser-Vandewalle and her team, to ensure an optimal integration of the neuromate® into their surgical workflow, helping them in the strive to provide the best possible outcomes for their patients."</p>
