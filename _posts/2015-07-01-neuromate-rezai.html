<h2>neuromate® frameless Gen II robot installation and first deep brain stimulation (DBS) performed in the USA at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center</h2>

<p><strong>July 2015</strong> - Renishaw is pleased to announce that a neuromate® frameless Gen II stereotactic robotic system has been installed at the Department of Neurological Surgery at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>Ali Rezai, MD, Professor of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience and Director, OSU Center for Neuromodulation, is the head of the team who performed the first case in the USA using the neuromate frameless Gen II system for the implantation of DBS electrodes.</p>

<p>Dr. Rezai said, "We believe that robotic technology has an exciting future in the neurosurgery operating rooms for DBS, brain infusion, endoscopy and other applications. Based on our very first robotic DBS procedure we see procedural and time saving advantages."</p>

<p>Dr. Abed Hammoud, CEO of Renishaw Mayfield SA said, "We are very proud to have Dr. Rezai and his team among our partners, and will work closely with them to ensure the seamless integration of the neuromate® into their workflow."</p>
