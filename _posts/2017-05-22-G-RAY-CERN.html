<p>Neuchâtel, Switzerland, 22.05.2017 &mdash; G-ray Switzerland, a company developing leading edge particle detection systems, is pleased to announce that it has signed with CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, an R&D collaboration agreement on characterisation of charge transfer process across low temperature bonded interfaces.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>"We are pleased to have established a close collaboration with one of the world's most advanced research institution closely connected with our field"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>CERN aims at maximizing the impact of its technologies by transferring it to other disciplines for the benefit of society and industry. This collaboration is an opportunity for CERN and G-ray to explore the performance of low temperature bonding processes using already established characterisation techniques.</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of this agreement is to establish the performance of silicon wafers that are bonded using G-ray's low-temperature bonding approach with CMOS read-out reference wafers from CERN. EMPA, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology, which is another strategic partner of G-ray, is also involved.</p>
