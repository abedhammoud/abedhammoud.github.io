<p>Current neurosurgical procedures face significant obstacles due to the limitations of precision imaging and real-time surgical guidance. These difficulties not only affect surgical efficiency, but also limit patient outcomes, slowing down the integration of innovative neurotechnologies.</p>

<p>Geneva Wyss Center spin-off Clee Medical is addressing these critical issues by developing innovative imaging and sensing technology, as well as AI-driven navigation technology, that enables the brain to be visualized in real time and at very high resolution during surgery, without the need for contrast agents or radiation. Offering 300,000 more voxels per unit volume than MRI, this technology integrates easily with existing neurosurgical equipment and can easily be integrated into current operating routines.</p>

<p>Targeting a global market valued at 2.2 billion Swiss francs, Clee Medical is set to redefine stereotactic and functional neurosurgery. With prestigious medical centres as key customers, the company's technology promises unprecedented precision, reduced surgical risk, increased operating capacity and expanded treatment possibilities. Venture Kick funding will enable Clee Medical to strengthen its collaborations with leading neurosurgeons and institutions, accelerate the engagement of early adopters, and move rapidly towards a first stage of human clinical trials.</p>

<p>Clee Medical was co-founded by Matt Lapinski, an accomplished entrepreneur with over a decade of success in Boston's dynamic medical device industry, and Dr. Abed Hammoud, a seasoned innovator with over 30 years of experience in stereotactic neurosurgery and technology companies.</p>

<blockquote>"Venture Kick has been an important part of our journey, providing funding, strategic advice and access to an incredible network of entrepreneurs and experts," commented Matthew Lapinski, CEO and co-founder of Clee Medical.</blockquote>

<p>"We are truly grateful for the opportunity and support that has helped us refine our vision and accelerate our impact. We look forward to continuing and applying the lessons learned from the Venture Kick process to improve minimally invasive brain surgery worldwide!"</p>
