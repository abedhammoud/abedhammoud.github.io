    Over the cackle of static, Abed Hammoud whispers to me through his surgical mask: "This is the frontier of medical technology."
  </p>
  <p>
    Hammoud is not a surgeon. He has a PhD in biomedical engineering and works for Medtronic Corporation. This snowy morning in December, he is in Operating Room Number Eleven at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. He is operating the Silicon Graphics computer and Medtronic's software that is allowing Clinic neurosurgeons Ali Rezai and Erwin Montgomery to ever so slowly push an electrode the size of a hair deep into the brain of a man named Russell Purdue, in a procedure called deep brain stimulation (DBS).

    Grill received a $1.6 million, five-year grant from the National Institutes of Health to answer this fundamental question: Which neuronal elements are affected by the stimulation – the local neuron cells touched by the electrode or the passing axon output flowing between those cells? He uses computer-based models to do his testing and relies on Dr. Montgomery's clinical research to corroborate the computer. Once Grill and Montgomery determine which neuronal elements are affected by the stimulation, they'll work on the technology of the stimulation.

    "The hope is that all doctors will one day be as comfortable prescribing electricity as they are prescribing medication," says Montgomery.

    Rezai expects that, any day now, the FDA will grant final approval to DBS as a standard treatment for Parkinson's tremor. Other emerging areas for DBS use are epilepsy, chronic pain and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

    In June 2001, Cleveland will host the international symposium Functional and Restorative Neurosurgery: Defining the Future. "Fifty of the world's leading authorities and pioneers on neuromodulation - the All-Stars - will be here for three days," says Rezai. "It will be exciting to bring these minds together to chart the course of neurosurgery."

    And then, probing minds will listen in as the brain talks.
