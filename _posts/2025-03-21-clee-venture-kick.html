<p>🌟We are excited to announce that one of our spin-offs, Clee Medical SA, has won the third stage of the Venture Kick program—an initiative that supports the development of high-potential businesses in Switzerland! 🎉 The start-up has secured CHF 150,000 to further its groundbreaking neurosurgical technology.</p>

<p>By combining advanced imaging with AI-assisted guidance, Clee Medical is addressing key challenges in neurosurgery—enhancing visualization, reducing surgical risks, and expanding treatment possibilities. Their innovative technology seamlessly integrates into existing workflows, offering 300,000 more voxels per unit volume than MRI—without contrast agents or radiation.</p>

<p>👏 We are thrilled to see CleeMedical's work recognized for bringing next-generation technology to neurosurgeons, advancing precision, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.</p>
