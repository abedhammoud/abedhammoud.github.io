<p><strong>Chaudefontaine, France, 2019.01.04</strong> - More than 40 years ago, DIXI Medical designed and manufactured its first deep electrode for SEEG. Today, DIXI’s products are marketed in more than 30 countries.</p>

<p>In order to meet the increasing demand for its products and to anticipate future needs, particularly those related to the evolution of epilepsy surgical techniques, DIXI Medical has been engaged in a major reorganization process for several months.</p>

<p>In a previous communication, DIXI Medical announced developments related to its production facilities. The move to new state-of-the-art premises is now complete. DIXI’s capacity objective will be achieved before the end of the first quarter of 2019.</p>

<p>Beyond the operational aspect, DIXI has also adapted the company's management structure to meet the expectations of its customers and future challenges. The new organization is based on a more complete management team.</p>

<p>Since September 1st, 2018, Mr. Frédéric Koehn, also COO of Dixi Holding in Switzerland, has been named CEO of DIXI Medical. He will be strategically supported by Dr. Abed Hammoud, who has taken up the position of Senior Vice President Sales & Marketing since December 1st, 2018. In addition, the North American market is entrusted to Mr. Mark Lemko, who has been with the company since February 2018. The profiles of these new directors are available on the LinkedIn platform. They all have several decades of experience in the medical field, particularly in the management of high-growth companies.</p>

<p>On my side, I will continue to contribute my 40 years of experience to the company to help my colleagues in their corresponding roles and to ensure the day-to-day management of DIXI Medical and all aspects of production.</p>

<p>Dr. Hammoud will contact you personally in the coming days to discuss how we can continue to support you in providing the best care for your patients.</p>

<p>Through this communication, I wish to assure you of our total commitment to you and your patients. I am, of course, at your entire disposal for any additional information you may require.</p>

<p>Please accept, Madam, Sir, the expression of my very sincere greetings.</p>
