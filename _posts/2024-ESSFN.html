<p>It is a big honor to have my picture on the same slide with some of the pioneers in Deep Brain Stimulation who have made significant contributions to the field and to improving patients' lives worldwide. I have learned a lot from every one of you. Thank you for being a teacher and a friend.</p>

<p>Thank you, Marwan, thank you, ESSFN, and thank you, Stockholm, for a very memorable event.</p>
